GAIA (Game-Aware Intelligent Agent) is an advanced AI battle system for Pok√©mon that pits different Large Language Models against each other in strategic battles. This project allows multiple AI agents powered by leading LLMs (OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, and xAI's Grok) to compete in Pok√©mon battles on the Pok√©mon Showdown platform.

The primary goal of GAIA is to test, compare, and analyze the strategic decision-making capabilities of these different LLMs in the complex and dynamic environment of Pok√©mon battles. By observing their performance, we aim to gain insights into their problem-solving skills, adaptability, and overall effectiveness in strategic game settings.

## üåü Features

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Battle with agents powered by OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), or xAI (Grok)
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Agents analyze type matchups, move effectiveness, and battle state
- **Battle Memory**: Agents remember opponent strategies and adapt accordingly
- **Type Analysis System**: In-depth evaluation of type advantages and disadvantages
- **Automated Battles**: Run single matches or tournaments with configurable settings
- **Battle Monitoring**: Ensures battles complete successfully with timeouts and recovery mechanisms
- **Local Server**: Built-in setup for a local Pok√©mon Showdown server

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core System Architecture

This section details the main components of the GAIA system and how they interact.

### Key Python Scripts

The GAIA system is composed of several key Python scripts that work together:

- **`run_battles.py` - Battle Orchestration**: This is the main script for initiating and managing Pok√©mon battles. It handles command-line arguments, sets up the battle environment, creates the specified AI agents (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), and coordinates the matches between them or against human players. It also manages tournament mode, running multiple battles and aggregating results.

- **`gaia_agent.py` - The GAIA Agent Brain**: This script defines the `GAIAAgent` class, which is the core decision-making entity for each AI player. It integrates the various intelligence features like `BattleMemory`, `TypeAnalyzer`, and the `StrategicDecisionEngine`. The `GAIAAgent` processes battle state information from Pok√©mon Showdown, consults its internal modules, and decides on the next move.

- **`agents.py` - LLM API Interaction**: This script contains the classes responsible for interacting with the different Large Language Model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, xAI Grok). Each class handles the specifics of sending requests to its respective LLM (e.g., formatting prompts, API key management, parsing responses) and returning the LLM's suggested move or strategy to the `GAIAAgent`.

- **`utils.py` - Utilities and Analysis**: This script provides a collection of utility functions supporting the entire system. This includes the `TypeAnalyzer` logic for evaluating Pok√©mon type matchups and move effectiveness, functions for formatting complex battle state information into prompts for the LLMs, and other helper functions used across the project.

- **`player_fix.py` - Enhanced Battle Monitoring**: This script enhances the `poke-env` library's player class with improved battle monitoring and timeout handling. It helps ensure that battles complete successfully, even if an LLM or the connection to Pok√©mon Showdown is slow, by implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### üß† Agent Intelligence Features

Each `GAIAAgent` is equipped with several advanced systems to inform its decisions:

#### Type Analyzer
(Located in `utils.py`)
Evaluates type matchups between Pok√©mon and calculates move effectiveness. The system:
- Analyzes offensive and defensive type matchups.
- Identifies super-effective, normal, and resistant type interactions.
- Rates available moves based on type advantage, Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB), and base power.
- Provides strategic recommendations for move selection and Pok√©mon switching.

#### Battle Memory
(Integrated within `GAIAAgent` in `gaia_agent.py`)
Tracks and learns from battle patterns as a match progresses:
- Records the opponent's Pok√©mon, their known moves, and potential abilities.
- Tracks the success and failure rates of moves used by both sides.
- Observes opponent switching patterns and common strategies.
- Provides historical context to the `StrategicDecisionEngine` and the LLM.

#### Strategic Decision Engine
(A core component of `GAIAAgent` in `gaia_agent.py`)
This engine makes nuanced battle decisions. It processes information from the `TypeAnalyzer`, `BattleMemory`, and the current battle state. Its role is to:
- Identify clear-cut situations where an optimal move can be determined without LLM intervention (e.g., using a super-effective move to KO a low-HP opponent).
- For more complex situations, compile a comprehensive prompt for the LLM, including current Pok√©mon, opponent's Pok√©mon, available moves, type analysis, and battle history.
- Evaluate the LLM's suggestions, ensuring they are valid and strategically sound before execution.
- Manage game phases (early, mid, late game) to adjust strategic priorities.

### üîÅ Decision-Making Workflow

The decision-making process for a `GAIAAgent` each turn is as follows:

1.  **Receive Battle State**: The `GAIAAgent` receives the current battle state from the Pok√©mon Showdown server via `poke-env`. This includes information about active Pok√©mon, available moves, HP, status conditions, etc.
2.  **Consult Internal Heuristics (Strategic Decision Engine)**:
    *   The `StrategicDecisionEngine` first analyzes the situation using `TypeAnalyzer` and `BattleMemory`.
    *   It checks for "obvious" best moves:
        *   If a move guarantees a knockout on the opponent's active Pok√©mon and the agent's Pok√©mon is not at immediate risk.
        *   If a switch is tactically critical (e.g., to save a key Pok√©mon from a knockout blow or bring in a counter).
    *   If such a move is identified, the `StrategicDecisionEngine` may select it directly.
3.  **Invoke LLM for Complex Decisions**:
    *   If no clear-cut move is apparent, or for higher-level strategic planning, the `StrategicDecisionEngine` prepares a detailed prompt for the selected LLM (via `agents.py`).
    *   This prompt includes:
        *   Current team and opponent's known team.
        *   Active Pok√©mon details (HP, status, available moves, types, abilities).
        *   Opponent's active Pok√©mon details (known moves, types, HP, status).
        *   Output from `TypeAnalyzer` (effectiveness of own moves, opponent's potential threats).
        *   Relevant data from `BattleMemory` (opponent's past tendencies, successful moves).
        *   The overall battle history and turn count.
    *   The LLM processes this information and suggests a move (attack or switch) and potentially a brief rationale.
4.  **Validate and Execute Move**:
    *   The `GAIAAgent` receives the LLM's suggestion.
    *   The `StrategicDecisionEngine` validates the move (e.g., is it a legal move in the current context?).
    *   If valid, the `GAIAAgent` sends the chosen move to the Pok√©mon Showdown server.
5.  **Update Battle Memory**: After the turn resolves, `BattleMemory` is updated with new information from the turn's events.

This workflow combines deterministic logic for clear situations with advanced LLM-driven insights for complex strategic choices, aiming for a balance of speed, reliability, and sophisticated play.

# Grok vs Gemini
python3 run_battles.py --mode ai_vs_ai --agent1 grok --agent2 gemini --battles 1
```

##### Additional Options

```bash
# Run battles with longer timeouts (5 min per turn, 30 min per battle)
python3 run_battles.py --mode ai_vs_ai --agent1 anthropic --agent2 gemini --battles 1 --turn-timeout 300 --battle-timeout 1800

# Battle against random player
python3 run_battles.py --mode ai_vs_ai --agent1 openai --agent2 random --battles 1

# Use a specific battle format
python3 run_battles.py --mode ai_vs_ai --agent1 openai --agent2 anthropic --format gen9randombattle --battles 1

# Run multiple battles at once
python3 run_battles.py --mode ai_vs_ai --agent1 openai --agent2 anthropic --battles 5
```

#### Tournament Mode

Run a round-robin tournament that automatically plays all LLM combinations against each other:

```bash
# Standard tournament with 1 battle per matchup
python3 run_battles.py --mode tournament --battles 1

# Tournament with extended timeouts
python3 run_battles.py --mode tournament --battles 1 --turn-timeout 300 --battle-timeout 1800

# Tournament with more battles per matchup
python3 run_battles.py --mode tournament --battles 3
```

Tournament mode is the easiest way to run all possible LLM agent combinations against each other in a single command. The system will automatically:

1. Create agents for all available LLM providers (those with API keys in your .env file)
2. Run battles between each pair of agents (all possible combinations)
3. Track and report win rates across all matches
4. Output comprehensive tournament statistics at the end

This provides a great way to benchmark different LLM models' performance in strategic Pokemon battles.

#### Command-line Options

```
--mode          Battle mode: ai_vs_ai, tournament, accept_human, challenge_human
--agent1        First agent (for ai_vs_ai): openai, anthropic, gemini, grok, random
--agent2        Second agent (for ai_vs_ai): openai, anthropic, gemini, grok, random
--battles       Number of battles to run
--format        Battle format (default: gen9randombattle)
--turn-timeout  Maximum seconds per turn (default: 180s)
--battle-timeout Maximum seconds per battle (default: 1200s)
--human         Human username for challenge mode
--listen        Keep listening for challenges from humans
```

### üîç Viewing Battles

Battles are displayed in the Pok√©mon Showdown interface:

1. Go to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser
2. Enter any username and click "Choose Name"
3. Click "Watch a battle" in the left sidebar
4. You should see ongoing battles listed - click on one to watch

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Username Already Taken Errors**
   - This happens when a previous session didn't properly close
   - Run the cleanup script: `chmod +x cleanup.sh && ./cleanup.sh`
   - Then restart the server with `./setup_server.sh`

2. **Battles Start But Don't Complete**
   - Use longer timeouts: `--turn-timeout 300 --battle-timeout 1800`
   - If that doesn't work, clean up and restart the server

3. **API Key Errors**
   - Verify that your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Ensure there are no spaces around the equals sign
   - Check that you have access to the specified models

4. **Server Connection Issues**
   - Make sure the server is fully initialized before starting battles
   - Run the cleanup script and restart the server if you encounter connection errors

#### Server Cleanup and Restart

The cleanup script provides an easy way to reset the server:

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already)
chmod +x cleanup.sh

# Run the cleanup script to kill all servers and clean logs
./cleanup.sh

# Start a fresh server
./setup_server.sh
```

### üìä Battle Examples

#### Individual Matchups

```bash
# OpenAI vs Claude (3 battles)
python3 run_battles.py --mode ai_vs_ai --agent1 openai --agent2 anthropic --battles 3

# Claude vs Gemini (5 battles)
